In the case of an LDAP server, this means that an attacker could cause a client to make decisions based on false records from the LDAP directory. The risk of an attacker pulling this off can be decreased by implementing strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Furthermore, implementing Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000424-GPOS-00188","false_positives":"","false_negatives":"","documentable":"false","security_override_guidance":"","potential_impacts":"","third_party_tools":"","ia_controls":"","responsibility":"","mitigations":"","mitigation_control":"","legacy_ids":[],"ccis":["CCI-002418","CCI-002421"],"uuid":"05414017-ab7c-44d9-93a7-05f163a7637e","stig_uuid":"fde4d960-b271-4bd1-a6be-702ca36c8014","target_key":"","stig_ref":"","status":"not_applicable","overrides":{},"comments":"","comments_classification":"null","finding_details":"Evaluate-STIG 1.2410.0 (Scan-WindowsServer2019_Checks) found this to be NOT APPLICABLE on 01/23/2025:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSystem is a 'Member Server' so this requirement is NA.\r\n","finding_details_classification":"null"},{"group_tree":[{"id":"V-205821","title":"SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187","description":"<GroupDescription></GroupDescription>"}],"group_id":"V-205821","severity":"medium","group_title":"Windows Server 2019 setting Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) must be configured to Enabled.","rule_id_src":"SV-205821r958908_rule","rule_id":"SV-205821r958908","rule_version":"WN19-SO-000060","rule_title":"Windows Server 2019 setting Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) must be configured to Enabled.","fix_text":"Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> \"Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always)\" to \"Enabled\".","weight":"10.0","check_content":"If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding:\n\nRegistry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \nRegistry Path: \\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Netlogon\\Parameters\\\n\nValue Name: RequireSignOrSeal\n\nValue Type: REG_DWORD\nValue: 0x00000001 (1)","check_content_ref":{"href":"Microsoft_Windows_Server_2019_STIG.xml","name":"M"},"classification":"UNCLASSIFIED","discussion":"Requests sent on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as passwords) is encrypted, but not all information is encrypted.
