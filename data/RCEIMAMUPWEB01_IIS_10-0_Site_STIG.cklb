The .cgi file extension does represent a CGI script, but CGI scripts may be written in a number of programming languages (e.g., PERL, C, PHP, and JavaScript), each having their own unique file extension.\n\nThe use of CGI scripts represent one of the most common and exploitable means of compromising a web server. By definition, CGI scripts are executable by the operating system of the host server. While access control is provided via the web service, the execution of CGI programs is not limited unless the System Administrator (SA) or the Web Manager takes specific measures.
