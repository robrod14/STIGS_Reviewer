Care must be taken with user credentials, automatic logon performance, and how default Windows credentials are passed to the websites. This policy setting allows management of settings for logon options. If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from varying logon options. “Anonymous logon” disables HTTP authentication and uses the guest account only for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. “Prompt for user name and password” queries users for user IDs and passwords. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone” queries users for user IDs and passwords in other zones. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session. “Automatic logon with current user name and password” attempts logon using Windows NT Challenge Response. If Windows NT Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network user name and password for login. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported by the server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you disable this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”. If you do not configure this policy setting, logon is set to “Automatic logon only in Intranet zone”.
