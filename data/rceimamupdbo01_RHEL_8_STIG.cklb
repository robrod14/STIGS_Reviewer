The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.\n\nUtilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system startup.\n\nUser home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature. Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with an SA through shared resources.\n\nRHEL 8 ships with many optional packages.

This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nRHEL 8 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.
